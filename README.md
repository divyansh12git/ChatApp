Welcome to **ChatApp**, a modern and feature-rich messaging application designed for seamless communication. Below is an overview of our progress so far, detailing the features implemented in **Phase 1**, the roadmap for **Phase 2**, and the technologies powering ChatApp.

## **Phase 1 Completed:**  
####  10/07/2024 - 17/01/2025
I am extremely excited to announce the successful completion of Phase 1 of ChatApp! While the application is still under development, the foundation is set with these core features:  

- **Authentication Module**:  
  Provides secure and seamless login and signup functionality, ensuring data privacy and user-friendly onboarding.  

- **User Search**:  
  Users can search for others by their username, making it easy to find and connect with friends.  

- **Friend Request Module**:  
  A dedicated system to send, accept, or reject friend requests, enabling users to build their friend network.  

- **Real-time Messaging**:  
  Instant communication is achieved through a robust socket-based implementation, ensuring messages are delivered in real time without delays.  

- **Message and Friend History**:  
  Persistent storage of messages and friendship data, allowing users to view past conversations and maintain their connections.  

### Reflections on Phase 1  
Developing Phase 1 has been a rewarding journey. The process involved extensive coding, debugging, and sleepless nights planning implementations. Finally it's good to see ChatApp working smoothly.

## **What's Next: Phase 2**  

As I continue to expand ChatApp, the focus for Phase 2 includes these exciting enhancements:  

- **User Profile Management**:  
  Users will be able to personalize their profiles by adding custom photos and writing a bio, enhancing individuality and interaction.  

- **Complet JWT Authentication and encryption**:
  Every requesting will be proceeded only after verifyling the token and all the data will be encrpting durng transmissing and storing in db.

- **Logout Module**:  
  Securely log out of the application with a streamlined, user-friendly process.  

- **UI Improvements**:  

- **Redis Integration**:  
  Implement database caching with Redis to improve performance and reduce server load during high-traffic scenarios.  

- **Online Status**:   

- **Friend Groups (Chat Rooms)**:
